# fecdb &ndash; database scripts for FEC bulk data #

## Project ##

### Overview ###

This project contains simple scripts for the following:

* Downloading bulk data files from the FEC (Federal Election Commission) website
* Creating RDBMS (PostgreSQL) tables for the FEC data sets
* Loading the FEC bulk data into the database
* Indexes and views for supporting various queries against the database
* Sample SQL queries for exploring specific scenarios within the data

### FEC Data Sets ###

The following data sets from the [FEC website][1] are currently supported:

| Name (with link) | FEC name | PostgreSQL table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Candidate Master][2] | cn | `cand` |
| [Candidate Financials][3] | weball | `cand_fins` |
| [Committee Master][4] | cm | `cmte` |
| [Committee Financials][5] | webk | `cmte_fins` |
| [Committee Contributions][6] | pas2 | `cmte_contrib` |
| [Committee Miscellaneous Transactions][7] | oth | `cmte_misc` |
| [Candidate-Committee Link][8] | ccl | `cand_cmte` |
| [Individual Contributions][9] | indiv | `indiv_contrib` |

In addition, the following tables have been created for reference data (code lookups), in support
of the bulk data

| Name (with link) | PostgreSQL table |
| --- | --- |
| [Transaction Type][10] | `transaction_type` |
| [Committee Type][11] | `cmte_type` |
| [Party][12] | `party` |

### Database Design Principles ###

* Preserve original data fields and values as much as possible (e.g. for traceability)&mdash;exceptions:
    * Normalize date fields so they will import as native PostgreSQL `DATE` types
    * Fix-up of spaces and commas in `name` field (`indiv` data set only, for now)
* Extensions to the original schema:
    * Primary key (autogenerated `BIGINT`)
    * Election cycle field (`elect_cycle`), based on source data set year (e.g. 2000, 2002, etc.)
    * Election cycle table (`election_cycle`), containing reference information for each cycle (e.g. election day date)
    * Inferred **individual "master"** tables (see below)
    * Individual aliases and groups (see below)
* The objective is to leverage the database in doing some of the heavy lifting for big data
  processing, but not have it try and do too much stuff it is not good at.  The best use would
  be to extract joined subsets and rollups for processing and visualization in tools that are
  better-suited for detailed analytics such as Excel, Python (e.g. Pandas/Jupyter notebooks),
  R, etc.

### Individual Master Data ###

A major challenge with the individual contribution data is that there are no "master" individual
records (e.g. the way there are with candidates and committees), so it is difficult to determine
with integrity which contributions were made by the same individual, or different indidividuals
with the same, or similar, names.  To rectify, we extract unique combinations of name (standardized
as well as we can) and other identifying information (e.g. address, employment) into separate tables
to serve as makeshift **individual master** tables.  From there, we can do further processing and
correlation to identify additional possible duplication across master records, which we designate
as **aliases**, in order to achive more accurate (truthful?) query results.

To augment the capabilities of the individual master data, we introduce the notion of individual
**groups**, each of which is a static list of individuals (and hence their aliases) we may wish
to consider collectively in queries and the search for insights.

Here are the tables introduced in support of the (inferred) individual master data:

| PostgreSQL table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `indiv` | Distinct name, city, state, and zip_code values |
| `indiv2` | Distinct name, city, state, zip_code, employer, and occupation values |
| `indiv_alias` | Connection between `indiv` (or `indiv2`) records deemed to represent the same person |
| `indiv_group` (and `indiv_group_indiv`) | Ability to group individuals together (static list) for purposes of analysis or reporting |

### Status ###

This is very early work, still in process.  In particular, indexes and views will be added as the specific semantics
of the data sets are better understood.  And sample queries will be added as various questions to answer are better
defined.

### To Do ###

* More documentation
* Create a real **To Do** list

## Requirements ##

The current package is depenent on the following:

* PostgreSQL 10
* A unix-like environment (e.g. bash, gawk, sed, etc.)
    * Not yet tested on cygwin, but that is planned
* Python 3
    * Python is currently only used as a scripting tool, thus only standard libraries are used, and there
      is no need to create a virtual environment for this project.  Later, if more complex Python-based
      functionality is introduced, the external library requirements will be listed.

These should be installed in your environment before proceeding with the set up instructions below.

## Setting Things Up ##

*The following example steps show the process for dowloading and loading the 2020 election data (resulting in a ~600MB database).
All of the scripts support working with data from multiple elections years (named after the even years)&mdash;fuller documentation
to come.*

### Download data sets ###

    $ cd data
    $ ../scripts/wget_fec_data.sh 2020
    $ ls *.zip
    $ cd ..

*Note that the `wget_fec_data.sh` script is pretty basic, so only downloads into the current working directory*

### Create database and tables ###

    $ createdb fecdb
    $ psql -f sql/create_tables.sql fecdb

*Note that any of the command line database operations in this step (or following steps) can also be done equivalently
through a GUI (e.g. pgadmin).*

### Load data ###

    $ python3 scripts/load_fec_data.py all 2020 fecdb
    $ psql -c "\\copy transaction_type from 'data/transaction_type.txt'" fecdb
    $ psql -c "\\copy cmte_type from 'data/cmte_type.txt'" fecdb
    $ psql -c "\\copy party from 'data/party.txt'" fecdb

### Create indexes ###

    $ psql -f sql/create_indexes.sql fecdb

## Issues ##

* Need to categorize the various transaction types into categories for accurate insights (see
  `data/transaction_type.xlsx` for a worksheet that might be helpful)
* Need to understand exact role of `cmte_id` and `other_id` for various transaction type
  categories in **Committee Contributions** and **Committee Miscellaneous Transactions**
* Probably need to rename **Committee Contributions** and **Committee Miscellaneous Transactions**
  (both entity and table names) once the various transactions within them are better understood
